# Machine Learning Fundamentals: Part 3 - Unsupervised Learning and Clustering

Welcome to Part 3 of our Machine Learning Fundamentals series! After covering [supervised learning algorithms](/blog/ml-fundamentals-part-2-supervised-learning), we now turn to unsupervised learning - the art of finding hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.

## What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is like being a detective - you have clues (data) but no clear answers (labels). The algorithm must discover hidden structures, patterns, and relationships in the data on its own. This makes it both challenging and exciting, as you never know what insights you might uncover.

## Types of Unsupervised Learning

### 1. Clustering
Groups similar data points together.
- **Goal**: Find natural groupings in data
- **Examples**: Customer segmentation, gene sequencing, image segmentation

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction
Reduces the number of features while preserving important information.
- **Goal**: Simplify data while retaining key patterns
- **Examples**: Data visualization, noise reduction, feature extraction

### 3. Association Rule Learning
Finds relationships between different variables.
- **Goal**: Discover rules that describe relationships
- **Examples**: Market basket analysis, recommendation systems

### 4. Anomaly Detection
Identifies unusual or outlier data points.
- **Goal**: Find data points that don't fit normal patterns
- **Examples**: Fraud detection, network security, quality control

## Clustering Algorithms

### K-Means Clustering

K-Means is the most popular clustering algorithm, partitioning data into k clusters.

#### How it Works
1. Choose the number of clusters (k)
2. Randomly initialize k cluster centers (centroids)
3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid
4. Update centroids to the mean of assigned points
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until convergence

#### Mathematical Foundation
The algorithm minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS):

$$WCSS = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_i} ||x - \mu_i||^2$$

Where:
- $C_i$ is the i-th cluster
- $\mu_i$ is the centroid of cluster i
- $||x - \mu_i||^2$ is the squared Euclidean distance

#### Advantages
- Simple and fast
- Works well with spherical clusters
- Scales well to large datasets
- Guaranteed convergence

#### Disadvantages
- Requires choosing k in advance
- Sensitive to initialization
- Assumes spherical clusters
- Sensitive to outliers

#### Choosing the Right k
- **Elbow Method**: Plot WCSS vs k, look for the "elbow"
- **Silhouette Analysis**: Measure how similar points are to their own cluster vs other clusters
- **Gap Statistic**: Compare WCSS to random data

### Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering creates a tree-like structure of clusters.

#### Types
1. **Agglomerative (Bottom-up)**: Start with individual points, merge similar clusters
2. **Divisive (Top-down)**: Start with all points, recursively split clusters

#### Linkage Criteria
- **Single Linkage**: Minimum distance between clusters
- **Complete Linkage**: Maximum distance between clusters
- **Average Linkage**: Average distance between all pairs
- **Ward Linkage**: Minimizes within-cluster variance

#### Advantages
- No need to specify number of clusters beforehand
- Creates a hierarchy of clusters
- Deterministic results
- Works with any distance measure

#### Disadvantages
- Computationally expensive O(n³)
- Sensitive to noise and outliers
- Difficult to handle large datasets
- Hard to undo previous steps

### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)

DBSCAN groups together points in high-density areas and marks points in low-density areas as outliers.

#### Key Parameters
- **eps (ε)**: Maximum distance between two points to be neighbors
- **min_samples**: Minimum number of points to form a dense region

#### Point Types
- **Core Points**: Have at least min_samples neighbors within eps distance
- **Border Points**: Within eps distance of a core point but not core themselves
- **Noise Points**: Neither core nor border points (outliers)

#### Advantages
- Automatically determines number of clusters
- Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters
- Robust to outliers
- Identifies noise points

#### Disadvantages
- Sensitive to hyperparameters
- Struggles with varying densities
- High-dimensional data challenges
- Memory intensive for large datasets

## Dimensionality Reduction

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA finds the directions (principal components) that capture the most variance in the data.

#### How it Works
1. Standardize the data
2. Compute the covariance matrix
3. Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors
4. Sort by eigenvalue magnitude
5. Select top k eigenvectors as principal components
6. Transform data to new coordinate system

#### Mathematical Foundation
PCA finds the projection that maximizes variance:

$$\max_w \text{Var}(X \cdot w) \text{ subject to } ||w||^2 = 1$$

#### Advantages
- Reduces dimensionality while preserving variance
- Removes correlation between features
- Helps with visualization
- Reduces computational complexity

#### Disadvantages
- Linear transformation only
- Components may not be interpretable
- Requires scaling of features
- May lose important information

#### Choosing Number of Components
- **Explained Variance Ratio**: Keep components that explain 80-95% of variance
- **Scree Plot**: Look for the "elbow" in eigenvalue plot
- **Cross-Validation**: Use downstream task performance

### t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

t-SNE is excellent for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.

#### How it Works
1. Calculate pairwise similarities in high-dimensional space
2. Initialize random low-dimensional representation
3. Calculate pairwise similarities in low-dimensional space
4. Minimize divergence between high and low-dimensional similarities

#### Advantages
- Excellent for visualization
- Preserves local structure well
- Can reveal clusters and patterns
- Non-linear dimensionality reduction

#### Disadvantages
- Computationally expensive
- Non-deterministic results
- Hyperparameter sensitive
- Not suitable for new data projection

## Association Rule Learning

### Market Basket Analysis

Finds relationships between items frequently bought together.

#### Key Metrics
- **Support**: Frequency of itemset in dataset
- **Confidence**: Likelihood of consequent given antecedent
- **Lift**: How much more likely consequent is given antecedent

#### Example Rules
- {Bread, Butter} → {Milk} (Support: 0.3, Confidence: 0.8, Lift: 1.2)
- {Diapers} → {Beer} (Famous example from retail analytics)

#### Applications
- Recommendation systems
- Cross-selling strategies
- Website navigation analysis
- Protein sequences

## Anomaly Detection

### Statistical Methods

#### Z-Score Method
Identifies points that are many standard deviations away from the mean:

$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

Points with |z| > threshold (typically 2 or 3) are considered anomalies.

#### Interquartile Range (IQR) Method
Uses quartiles to identify outliers:
- Q1: 25th percentile
- Q3: 75th percentile
- IQR = Q3 - Q1
- Outliers: < Q1 - 1.5×IQR or > Q3 + 1.5×IQR

### Machine Learning Methods

#### Isolation Forest
Isolates anomalies by randomly selecting features and split values. Anomalies are easier to isolate and require fewer splits.

#### One-Class SVM
Learns a boundary around normal data points. Points outside this boundary are considered anomalies.

#### Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Compares local density of a point to the local densities of its neighbors. Points with significantly lower density are outliers.

## Evaluation Metrics for Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering Evaluation

#### Internal Metrics (No ground truth needed)
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar points are to their cluster vs other clusters
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster variance
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Average similarity between clusters

#### External Metrics (Ground truth available)
- **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**: Measures similarity to true clustering
- **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)**: Information shared between clusterings
- **Homogeneity and Completeness**: Cluster purity and coverage

### Dimensionality Reduction Evaluation
- **Explained Variance Ratio**: Proportion of variance preserved
