# Machine Learning Fundamentals: Part 2 - Supervised Learning Algorithms

Welcome back to our Machine Learning Fundamentals series! In [Part 1](/blog/ml-fundamentals-part-1-introduction), we covered the basics of machine learning. Now, let's dive deep into supervised learning algorithms - the most commonly used type of machine learning.

## What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is like learning with a teacher. The algorithm learns from labeled examples, where both the input (features) and the correct output (target) are provided. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

## Types of Supervised Learning

### 1. Regression
Predicts continuous numerical values.
- **Examples**: House prices, stock prices, temperature
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### 2. Classification
Predicts discrete categories or classes.
- **Examples**: Email spam detection, image recognition, medical diagnosis
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is the simplest and most fundamental algorithm in machine learning.

### How it Works
Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon$$

Where:
- $y$ is the target variable
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept
- $\beta_i$ are the coefficients
- $x_i$ are the features
- $\epsilon$ is the error term

### Advantages
- Simple and interpretable
- Fast training and prediction
- No hyperparameters to tune
- Good baseline model

### Disadvantages
- Assumes linear relationship
- Sensitive to outliers
- Requires feature scaling
- Can overfit with many features

### When to Use
- Linear relationships between features and target
- Need interpretable results
- Small to medium datasets
- As a baseline model

## Logistic Regression

Despite its name, logistic regression is used for classification problems.

### How it Works
Uses the logistic function (sigmoid) to map any real number to a value between 0 and 1:

$$p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n)}}$$

### Key Features
- Outputs probabilities instead of direct classifications
- Uses maximum likelihood estimation for training
- Can be extended to multi-class problems
- Provides feature importance through coefficients

### Advantages
- Probabilistic output
- No assumptions about feature distributions
- Less prone to overfitting
- Fast and efficient

### Disadvantages
- Assumes linear relationship between features and log-odds
- Sensitive to outliers
- Requires large sample sizes for stable results

## Decision Trees

Decision trees create a model that predicts target values by learning simple decision rules inferred from data features.

### How it Works
1. Start with the entire dataset
2. Find the best feature and threshold to split the data
3. Create branches based on the split
4. Repeat recursively for each branch
5. Stop when a stopping criterion is met

### Key Concepts
- **Root Node**: The top of the tree
- **Internal Nodes**: Decision points
- **Leaf Nodes**: Final predictions
- **Splitting Criteria**: Information Gain, Gini Impurity, Chi-square

### Advantages
- Easy to understand and interpret
- Requires little data preparation
- Handles both numerical and categorical features
- Can capture non-linear relationships

### Disadvantages
- Prone to overfitting
- Unstable (small data changes can result in different trees)
- Biased toward features with more levels
- Can create overly complex trees

### Preventing Overfitting
- **Pruning**: Remove branches that don't improve performance
- **Max Depth**: Limit tree depth
- **Min Samples Split**: Minimum samples required to split a node
- **Min Samples Leaf**: Minimum samples required in a leaf node

## Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to create a stronger predictor than any individual model.

### Random Forest

Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions.

#### How it Works
1. Create multiple bootstrap samples of the training data
2. Train a decision tree on each sample
3. For each split, consider only a random subset of features
4. Combine predictions by averaging (regression) or voting (classification)

#### Advantages
- Reduces overfitting compared to single decision trees
- Handles missing values well
- Provides feature importance
- Works well out-of-the-box

#### Disadvantages
- Less interpretable than single decision trees
- Can overfit with very noisy data
- Biased toward categorical variables with many categories

### Gradient Boosting

Gradient boosting builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects errors made by previous models.

#### Popular Implementations
- **XGBoost**: Extreme Gradient Boosting
- **LightGBM**: Light Gradient Boosting Machine
- **CatBoost**: Categorical Boosting

#### Advantages
- Often achieves state-of-the-art performance
- Handles missing values
- Built-in feature importance
- Good for both regression and classification

#### Disadvantages
- Prone to overfitting
- Requires hyperparameter tuning
- Longer training time
- Less interpretable

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVM finds the optimal boundary (hyperplane) that separates different classes with the maximum margin.

### Key Concepts
- **Support Vectors**: Data points closest to the decision boundary
- **Margin**: Distance between the hyperplane and nearest data points
- **Kernel Trick**: Transform data to higher dimensions for non-linear separation

### Common Kernels
- **Linear**: For linearly separable data
- **Polynomial**: For polynomial relationships
- **RBF (Radial Basis Function)**: For complex, non-linear relationships
- **Sigmoid**: Similar to neural networks

### Advantages
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces
- Memory efficient
- Versatile (different kernels)
- Works well with small datasets

### Disadvantages
- Poor performance on large datasets
- Sensitive to feature scaling
- No probabilistic output
- Difficult to interpret

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are inspired by biological neural networks and consist of interconnected nodes (neurons).

### Basic Structure
- **Input Layer**: Receives input features
- **Hidden Layers**: Process information
- **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions
- **Weights and Biases**: Parameters learned during training

### Activation Functions
- **ReLU**: Most common for hidden layers
- **Sigmoid**: For binary classification output
- **Softmax**: For multi-class classification output
- **Tanh**: Alternative to sigmoid

### Advantages
- Can learn complex non-linear relationships
- Flexible architecture
- Universal function approximators
- Good performance on large datasets

### Disadvantages
- Requires large amounts of data
- Computationally expensive
- Black box (difficult to interpret)
- Many hyperparameters to tune
